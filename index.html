                Environments shape our lives.  The places we hangout can determine how well we connect with others.  Some places help us or inspire us to open up and connect with others around us.

                        <li>Natural Beauty Scale – a cafe overlooking the ocean or a trail cutting through the mountains are good places for connection.</li>
                        <li>Noise level Scale – relative quiet is conducive to connection.  It is hard to connect if you have to strain to hear or be heard.</li>
                        <li>Interruption Scale – does the space allow you to linger? No one keeps track of time during a great conversations.  For example, if a waiter hurries you to pay the bill or leave the space, they lose marks.</li>
                        <li>Community Scale – What is the chance of talking to an interesting stranger?  Is the place frequented by interesting, friendly people or is it a place frequented by stressed out, hurried customers?</li>
                        <li>Engaging Space Scale –  Does the place itself spark conversation?  For example, a place that has an interesting history or frequently exhibits art may can provide catalyst for conversation.</li>
                        <li>Facilitation Scale – Do places facilitate connection?   Do they hold events that connect patrons?   For example, a yoga studio would likely rank much higher in this case than a cafe.</li>
